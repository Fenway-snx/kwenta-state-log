## Simple Summary
This proposal suggests an amendment to the protocol defined in KIP-45/75 to exclude the treasury's stake from receiving a portion of the 50% early vest fee that is meant for stakers.

## Abstract
Currently, under KIP 45/75, the 50% early vest fee is distributed proportionally to all stakers, including the treasury's stake. This proposal suggests a modification to the protocol to exclude the treasury wallet from this distribution since they already get 50%, effectively increasing the rewards for non-treasury stakers.

## Motivation
The motivation for this proposal stems from the belief that the treasury should not also benefit from the 50% meant for stakers. These fees are better served by being directed towards individual stakers as rewards for their commitment. Moreover, excluding the treasury from this distribution would provide a better incentive for individual network participants to stake their tokens.

## Specification
This KIP suggests modifying the allocation of the 50% early vest fee as follows:
