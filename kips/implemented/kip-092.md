## Simple Summary

This KIP suggests to rename the Kwenta Elite Council to Kwenta Council.

## Abstract

Change the name of the Elite Council to Kwenta Council.

## Motivation

The "Elite" naming scheme originated from the early days of Kwenta as a marketing theme to attract contributors to a new DAO. However now that the DAO matured it seems odd to call the community-elected council "Elite", which suggests that there is a special group running the DAO rather than five community-elected members with the mandate of voting on DAO decisions for the duration of an epoch.

It is therefore suggested to get rid of the elite theme and rename the Elite Council to simply being the Kwenta Council.

## Specification

To implement this KIP, the KSL needs to be updated the reflect the following:
    
    - All mentionings of Elite Council should be renamed to Kwenta Council
    - All abbreviations of the Elite Council (EC) should be renamed to KC
