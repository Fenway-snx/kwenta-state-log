## Simple Summary

Host the Kwenta State Log repository on GitHub for easier maintenance and community collaboration.

## Abstract

The current state of Radicle development does not allow for efficient and smooth maintenance and collaboration, resulting in too many disruptions and additional CC resources necessary to maintain it. To solve this, the KIP suggests moving the Kwenta State Log repository from Radicle to GitHub for easier maintenance and collaboration.

## Motivation

After several months of using Radicle, it became evident that the product is not stable mission ready. While Radicle has the potential to become an excellent protocol for decentralized code collaboration, the current stable version is difficult to maintain and collaborate on. Furthermore, the development of the existing legacy system has stopped in favor of a new version that has yet to ship. To make the submission of Kwenta Improvement Proposals (KIPs) and maintenance of KSL easier for community members, moving the repository to GitHub is proposed as a temporary solution.

## Specification

This KIP suggests the following changes:

- Host the Kwenta State Log on GitHub
- Clarify that active development as of now is happening on GitHub for both the frontend and KSL
- Update Elite Council endorsed links to decentralized code repositories and GitHub repository

-Due to Radicles current limitations while under active development, a gradual step-by-step approach is applied to avoid interruptions to the protocols development while giving contributors the chance to become familiar with Radicle and iron out any hiccups along the way.
