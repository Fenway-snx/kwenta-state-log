## Simple Summary

Pause the Kwenta $OP trading rewards program for one epoch due to the scheduled downtime of the Bedrock release.

## Abstract

The Optimism Bedrock upgrade is planned for 16:00 UTC on June 6, 2023, including approx. 4 hours of network downtime. Beginning on June 4th at 16:00 UTC, Synthetix Perps V2 will be limited to closing only for the 48 hours leading up to the scheduled upgrade. The $OP trading rewards should be paused to facilitate the planned downtime.

## Motivation

To disincentivize traders to trade during the epoch of the scheduled Optimism upgrade and respective expected downtime, the $OP trading rewards program should be paused for one epoch.

## Specification

- Pause the Kwenta $OP trading rewards program for epoch 6. This means that any trades made on Kwenta during epoch 6 will not receive $OP trading rewards.

- The $OP rewards program will be extended for one week to make up for the missed $OP rewards in epoch 6.
