## Summary

This proposal seeks to allocate sufficient $KWENTA to the adminDAO, ensuring the uninterrupted fulfillment of current and anticipated DAO responsibilities, which encompass both present and forthcoming LP incentives as well as other DAO roles and KIP incentives.

## Request

We request a transfer of 3,000 KWENTA tokens from the treasuryDAO to the adminDAO.

## Address

`oeth:0xF510a2Ff7e9DD7e18629137adA4eb56B9c13E885`

## Rationale

The adminDAO is responsible for managing and distributing funds to meet the monthly commitments of the DAO. Originally, seeded with ~5,000 Kwenta tokens. Over time, these funds were used for approved purposes overtime including but not limited to:

- Paying different subDAOs (Kwenta Council and TreasuryDAO_.
- Backing approved LP incentives from token inception to now.
- Providing community benefits such as retroactive payments and grants.

Now almost 10 months later, our initial funds are running low. To ensure we can continue to meet our obligations and support the community, we're asking for additional Kwenta tokens.
